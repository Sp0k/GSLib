# GSLib

GSLib is my very own Java library. It is made up of different packages that I
have written, each filled with different methods I either find myself using
often, or wanted to try coding for fun. I wanted the library to include the
following categories:

1. Utilities
2. Statistics
3. Math
4. Calculus

I am actively working on the library and updating it with more methods and bug
fixes. This is my first time writing a code library, so if there is any errors
or issues, please open an issue or contact me.

## Acknowledgements

I did not write all of the methods, some were written by friends that gave them
to me and others are modified methods found online. Inside of each package in
the library, the **README** explaining how to use the package will have more
details on the specific credits.
